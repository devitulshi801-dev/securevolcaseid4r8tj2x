				<h2>Frequent Asked Questions</h2>


				<h3>What is the difference between the Simulator and a real Exchange?</h3>
				<p>The main difference is that in our cryptocurrencies simulator you don’t have to put real money so there is no risk to lose it. It's the safest and easiest way to learn. </p>
				<p>Whether a new trader or a pro trader, you can try our free simulated crypto exchange without risking your money.</p>
				<p>We will never ask for any secret key and we will never ask you to add funds to your wallet, so please be aware if someone does.</p>
				<p>Our simulated cryptocurrencies exchange is also easier to use and understand than conventional ones although it also has advanced features so pro traders can improve their crypto trading too.</p>
				<p>In addition, when you are trading in the Simulator you will always be a "maker" (the one who creates the offer) and there is always a taker who will accept it immediately. In a real Exchange where you put your money, you can be a maker or taker and there is usually a waiting time until the transaction is confirmed (blocktime) which can vary from seconds to several minutes due to the computation time of the algorithm used by each currency, the available miners and the volume of demand in the market.</p>
				<h4>Is it worth investing real money in bitcoin?</h4>
				<p>Well, nobody knows for sure. What we know for sure is that trading is not easy and even when everything seems to be increasing, you can lose a lot of money if you can’t control your emotions or you invest way more that what you should.</p>
				<p>That’s why we have created the simulator. So you can try without risking your capital.</p>


				<h3>¿What exchange does the Simulator use?</h3>
				<p>Market Cap (Total Market Capitalization of a coin) is from coinmarketcap.com and prices from cryptocompare.com or coinpaprika.com Often the Simulator's charts do not match those of TradingView or other exchanges since we use data that takes as a reference the mix of about 90 exchanges to make a more balanced average worldwide.</p>


				<h3>What is the minimum transaction amount with cryptocurrencies?</h3>
				<p>Currently the minimum transaction is $0.01 USD. This number may vary depending on the Simulator gameplay.</p>


				<h3>I'm not receiving notifications</h3>
				<p>Make sure you have notifications enabled in <a href="https://cryptospaniards.com/simulator/account" rel="nofollow">Settings</a> and that you have verified your email, when you created your account we send you a welcome email, if you can't find it,  <a href="https://cryptospaniards.com/simulator/contact" rel="nofollow">send us an email</a> from that same address and we will activate it for you.</p>

				<h3>How does <i>Activity</i> work?</h3>
				Here you can find all the trades are happening at the moment. You can either see the activity of everyone or just the ones you are following.
				The filter can help you identify what are the best traders doing.

				<h3>How does <i>Charts</i> work?</h3>
				Here you can find your coins distribution in percentage (%) and the charts of all the coins trading in the simulator.

				<h3>How does <i>History</i> work?</h3>
				<p>Here is an example of the History:</p>
				<p style="width: 290px"><span class="sparkline" data-chart="10233,10233,10234,10229,10233,10240,10236,10236,10238,10246,10237,10241,10250,10245,10252,10261,10264,10264,10255,10253,10253,10255,10256,10255,10255,10266,10273,10279,10290,10290,10294,10316,10297,10294,10298,10293,10293,10264,10266,10260,10264,10261,10268,10274,10275,10276,10279,10279,10278,10273,10273,10279,10281,10284,10282,10289,10290,10284,10286,10281,10323,10350,10342,10317,10342"></span></p>
				<p>It is updated every hour and has a journey of about 3 days. Hovering over you can see the total capital (without decimals).</p>


				<h3>How does the <i>Top 50</i> work?</h3>
				<p>The Ranking is measured by the percentage of profitability. It doesn’t take into account how much capital you have since you can start with different ones. It would not be fair to rank by capital since many investors start with $100 while others with $100,000.</p>
				<p>We want you to try the simulator with the amount you would invest in real money so it feels closer to reality.</p>


				<h3>A cryptocurrency is missing</h3>
				<p>There are currently thousands of cryptocurrencies. In order not to saturate and keep the simulator practical and easy to use, we have chosen to show only the 30 most popular cryptocurrencies. Right now you have the following cryptocurrencies available (ordered by Market Cap):
					<span title="Bitcoin: Digital gold">BTC</span>, <span title="Ethereum: Programmable contracts and money">ETH</span>, <span title="Binance Coin: Pay Binance exchange fees">BNB</span>, <span title="Dogecoin: Serious meme Bitcoin clone">DOGE</span>, <span title="TRON: In-app-purchases">TRX</span>, <span title="Polkadot: Web 3.0 Blockchain Interoperability">DOT</span>, <span title="ChainLink: External data for contracts">LINK</span>, <span title="Ethereum Classic: Ethereum clone">ETC</span>, <span title="Monero: Private digital cash">XMR</span>, <span title="Axie Infinity">AXS</span>, <span title="EOS: Decentralized applications on WebAssembly">EOS</span>, <span title="0x: Open Protocol For Decentralized Exchange">ZRX</span>, <span title="Zilliqa: Next Generation, High Throughput Blockchain Platform">ZIL</span>, <span title="IOTA: Internet-of-things payments">IOT</span>, <span title="Basic Attention Token: Digital advertising between publishers, advertisers and users">BAT</span>, <span title="NEM: Batteries-included digital assets">XEM</span>, <span title="Decred: Bitcoin with alternative governance">DCR</span>, <span title="Ontology: High-performance public multi-chain project & distributed trust collaboration platform">ONT</span>, <span title="DigiByte: Faster Bitcoin">DGB</span>, <span title="OmiseGO: Baking, remittance, and exchange">OMG</span>, <span title="Solana: Crypto app builder support">SOL</span>, <span title="NEO: Chinese-market Ethereum">NEO</span>, <span title="Waves: Decentralized exchange and crowdfunding">WAVES</span>, <span title="Litecoin: Faster Bitcoin">LTC</span>, <span title="Stellar Lumens: Digital IOUs">XLM</span>, <span title="Cardano: Layered currency and contracts">ADA</span>, <span title="Ripple: Enterprise payment settlement network">XRP</span>, <span title="Tezos: Smart contracts">XTZ</span>, <span title="Zcash: Private digital cash">ZEC</span>, <span title="Bitcoin Cash: Bitcoin clone">BCH</span>, <span title="Bitcoin SV: Bitcoin Satoshi Vision">BSV</span>, </p>
				<p>If you would like us to add a cryptocurrency that is in the TOP 50, just contact us.</p>

				<h3>Can I promote my Telegram website / project / group in my profile?</h3>
				<p>Of course! The <a href="https://cryptospaniards.com/simulator/account" rel="nofollow">Description</a> field in your profile is designed for it, as long as it is useful and you do not spam. In fact, many signals channels use the Simulator to show potential users the reliability of their signals.</p>


				<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>

				<h3>Test strategies</h3>
				<p>The Simulator is a good way to test your strategies before investing real money. </p>
				<p>If you are new in the space, try the simulator with the amount of real money you are willing to invest and experience what are your feelings while your money is both growing or going south. We would recommend not to invest real money at least until you see what happens with your fake money when everything drops.</p>
				<p>Prices move up and down very fast. Even when everything seems to be increasing its value, you can have sudden important drops where you can lose a lot of money if you can’t hold it. And believe us, it’s not easy to hold when everything is red.</p>

				<h3>Diversify</h3>
				<p>Do not put all the eggs in one basket, diversifying reduces the risk of a strategy going terribly wrong.</p>

				<h3>Always have some spare <img src="static/coins/usd.png" class="symbol"> USD ready</h3>
				<p>Unless you have a very confident strategy, we recommend you don’t invest all your capital at once, remember to keep a percentage in case a very good opportunity arises. </p>
				<p>The world of cryptocurrencies is very sensitive to news and changes in legislation and suddenly a currency can jump. In the Telegram channel of CryptoSpaniards you can find out more.</p>

				<h3>Adapt your strategy to how much time you want to dedicate</h3>
				<p>There are many ways to trade, the most important difference is if you want to invest in the short, medium or long term.</p>

				<h4>Scalping</h4>
				<p>Short term, it requires you to review movements every hour and buy when it is low and sell when it is high several times a day with small profits. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalping.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">More info</a>.</p>

				<h4>Swing trading</h4>
				<p>Medium term, or approximately every few days or weeks. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swingtrading.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">More info</a>.</p>

				<h4>Buy and Hold</h4>
				<p>Long term, it is all about buying and expecting it to rise over time (HODL). <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyandhold.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">More info</a>.</p>

				<p>As you can imagine, for short-term trading you have to be more attentive and control the market with closer detail, although it also gives faster profits yet it can be very stressful and mean faster losses.</p>

				<p>The cryptocurrencies are much more volatile than the traditional Stock Market, also, within the whole range of cryptocurrencies there are some that are more stable than others based on their volume (Market Cap.), Keep that in mind and act accordingly, small coins can suddenly disappear and may not follow technical analysis patterns (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_retracement" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Fibonacci retracements</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Elliott waves</a> among others).</p>
